    "What is osteoporosis": "A bone disease that develops when bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, making bones fragile and more likely to break.",
    
    "Symptoms": [
      "Back pain (caused by fractured vertebra)",
      "Loss of height over time",
      "Stooped posture",
      "Bone fractures occurring more easily than expected"
    ],
    
    "Emergency Warning Signs": [
      "Sudden severe back pain (possible spinal fracture)",
      "Fracture from minor fall or bump",
      "Difficulty standing or walking"
    ],
    
    "What causes it?": "Aging, hormonal changes (especially in menopause), calcium/vitamin D deficiency, certain medications (like long-term steroids), and lifestyle factors (smoking, lack of exercise).",
    
    "Who is at higher risk?": [
      "Postmenopausal women",
      "People over age 50",
      "Those with family history of osteoporosis",
      "Long-term steroid users",
      "People with low calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency"
    ],
    
    "Diagnosis and Tests": [
      "DEXA scan (bone density test)",
      "FRAX score calculation for fracture risk",
      "Vertebral fracture assessment",
      "Blood tests (calcium, vitamin D levels)"
    ],
    
    "Management and Treatment": [
      "Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate)",
      "Calcium supplements (1000-1200 mg/day)",
      "Vitamin D supplements (600-800 IU/day)",

      "Loss of mobility and independence",
      "Permanent stooped posture"
    ],
    
    "Prevention": [
      "Adequate calcium intake throughout life",
      "Regular weight-bearing exercise",
      "Avoid smoking and limit alcohol",
      "Bone density testing at menopause or age 65"
    ],
    
    "When to Seek Care": [
      "Sudden severe back pain",
      "Loss of height >1 inch (2.5cm)",
